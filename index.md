# PhotonSquid

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of students from [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/) (read "N7") specialized in various fields inside the Computer science department. This organization aims to regroup open source projects that we think are worth looking at, and to provide a common ground for everyone to contribute to them.

## Under construction ðŸš§

We're using the basic jekyll generator to generate a static site at the moment, but this is temporary. The features available might be sufficient for a basic documentation, but it clearly is impossible to build a fully featured website using this infrastructure.

## What's next? ðŸš€

We'll be publishing releases and news here, so stay tuned for updates. To do so, you can follow us on [GitHub](https://github.com/PhotonSquid), and watch some of our [repositories](https://github.com/orgs/photonsquid/repositories).
